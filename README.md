Global Terrorism Analysis Python Project
Description
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) â€“ is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017. We will select a subset of the data suitable for our analysis and analyze terror activity across the global level as well as for India. We will use Python in Jupyter Notebooks for importing, preparing and cleaning the data. We will also perform Exploratory Data Analysis in Python and then visualize the data exported from python in Power BI to gather insights.
Tools Used
Python, Jupyter Notebooks, PowerBI
